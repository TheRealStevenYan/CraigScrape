# CraigScrape
A web scraping Discord bot which tracks Craigslist.

---
Coming soon!
### WHAT'S DONE:
- Searching Craigslist for posts
- Basic web scraping of titles, post IDs and links
- Implemented tracking for categories (track technology, cars, etc. rather than just all)
- User notifications

### IN PROGRESS:
- Implement the above into a discord bot (it's currently command line only)

### TODO:
- Scrape every Craigslist site (rather than just Craigslist Vancouver)
- Implement tracking for more features than just buy and sell
- Optimise code with async await
- And a bunch more stuff found in comments throughout the modules.
